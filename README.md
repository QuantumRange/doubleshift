## Doubleshift

press `SHIFT` twice to activate Doubleshift.\

By default it opens the command palette but you can set it to a different command. For example split vertically.\

It **works with every available command** including commands from other plugins. So if you have a plugin like the better command palette plugin installed you can choose the command to open it in the Doubleshift settings tab.
