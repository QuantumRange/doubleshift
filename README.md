## Doubleshift

press `Shift` twice to activate Doubleshift. By default, it opens the command palette, but you can change to whatever you want\

you can also add multiple other commands for whatever action you need to access frequently. \

It **works with every available command** including commands from other plugins. So if you have a plugin like the better command palette plugin installed you can choose the command to open it in the Doubleshift settings tab.
