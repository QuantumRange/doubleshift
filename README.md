By default it opens the command palette but you can set it to a different command. For example split vertically.\

It **works with every available command** including commands from other plugins. So if you have a plugin like the better command palette plugin installed you can choose the command to open it in the Doubleshift settings tab.

I used [Mom0aut's](https://github.com/mom0aut/obsidian-search-everywhere) plugin partially as a basis for this plugin so go check him out as his plugin gave me the idea to make this plugin
